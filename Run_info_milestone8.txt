Milestone8

#Make changes in the simulation_data.cpp file
#Change milestone to 8
 std::string milestone_number = "08";
directory = base_dir + "/output/milestone_" + milestone_number + "/" + number_of_layers + "/";

Choose configurations
layer_numbers = 10;
atomic_distance = 2.885; // atomic distance from reference clusters - corresponds to 408 pm lattice constant
mass = 196.9665* 103.6; // atomic mass of Gold (https://www.nuclear-power.com/gold-atomic-number-mass-density/)
total_steps = 5;
time_step = 1.0; // time step in fs
cutoff_radius = 10.0;    // cutoff radius for EAM potential
relaxation_time_multiplier = 10; // relaxation time = relaxation time multiplier * time_step in fs
stop_thermostate_after_steps = 500; // stop thermostat after this number of steps
relaxation_time_multiplier_final_value = 1e10; // after the system arrives at desired temp (stop thermostat and relax system)
desired_temperature = 500.0; // desired temperature (only in the start) in K


#Set MPI parameters
domain_length = {30.0, 30.0, 30.0}; // domain length in Angstrom
domain_grid = {2, 2, 2}; // number of domains in each direction
domain_periodicity = {0, 0, 0}; // periodicity of the domain in each direction

For this we will run command 2*2*2=8

so command: mpirun -n 8 ./milestones/08/milestone08
